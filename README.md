### Testing and Deployment ###

Project testing was carried out manually in Web browser. 

To remove horizontal scroll from all pages I added for Tag <Body> style (overflow-x:hidden;) and horizontal scroll line disappeared.
  
Added sticky-top class for header section to sticky menu on the top while scrolling page down.

Project CSS file called style.css have checked by online Validator https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/ and all critical errors were removed. Also HTML code of each page was checked and approved by online Validator by following link https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input.

Testing Home Page.

I begun testing from the first page of the project, Home. 
Most critical errors from this page was:
At the beginning of the project site Logo was located in the top-middle of page and had a big size, after that Logo had been moved to the left-top and minimized in size; 
Logo was not displayed as incorrect source link, fixed logo source link;
The same problem was with the background image source link, internal link was change to external link https://www.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/football-2518982_960_720.jpg and image started to display;
Menu toggle button worked incorrectly. When toggle button was pushed the main menu overlapped the image, the problem was fixed and now menu opens correctly and background image go down.
On some pages footer section was high in mobile version, have made some adjustments to move it down. 

Testing page About.

Page main text was displayed too much to the left side, it was fixed by moving it to center.

Testing page Gallery.

Text inside the image was too small, fixed by increase of the text size.
Side arrows inside image was too small, fixed by increase of the arrows size.
The photos for Gallery have been taken from free resource https://ru.freeimages.com/
Particular attention during development and testing was given to the mobile version of the site so that all elements do not go over each other or behind the screen. Many testing with fonts-sizes, elements colors, margins and paddings to make page looks good.
