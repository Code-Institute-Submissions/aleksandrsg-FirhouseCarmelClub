# Firehouse Football Club #

This project is developing for a real football club.
The original version of web site you could find by the following link http://www.firhousecarmel.com.
Firhouse Carmel Football Club was founded in 1974 to cater for Schoolboys and girls in the local area.
In this project you will find the new web site design for Club.

### UX ###

The main goal is help to find for  parents (site users / local community) information about  local football club for kids and youth.
On the other hand, the web sites owners will get more recognition and advertisement via
world wide web.

### Features ###

The web site consists from four conected with each other web pages.
The site developer could add new pages to this web site if necessary.
Page 1 is Home. from this section user could go to any sites sections or pages.
Page 2 is About, in this section the user will find information about club main aims and goals.
Page 3 is Contact, in the third section user will find all contact information such as phone number, email
and location map.
Page 4 Registration, in this section user will fill the registration form.
There is a extra link called Version 1.0 for visiting original web site.
Added Page 5 called Gallery with three fotos. 

### Testing and Deployment ###

Project testing was carried out manually in Web browser. 

Testing Home Page.

I begun testing from the first page of the project, Home. 
Most critical errors from this page was:
At the beginning of the project site Logo was located in the top-middle of page and had a big size, after that Logo had been moved to the left-top and minimized in size; 
Logo was not displayed as incorrect source link, fixed logo source link;
The same problem was with the background image source link, internal link was change to external link https://www.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/football-2518982_960_720.jpg and image started to display;
Menu toggle button worked incorrectly. When toggle button was pushed the main menu overlapped the image, the problem was fixed and now menu opens correctly and background image go down.
On some pages footer section was high in mobile version, have made some adjustments to move it down.

Testing page About.

Page main text was displayed too much to the left side, it was fixed by moving it to center.

Testing page Gallery.

Text inside the image was too small, fixed by increase of the text size.
Side arrows inside image was too small, fixed by increase of the arrows size.

Particular attention during development and testing was given to the mobile version of the site so that all elements do not go over each other or behind the screen. Many testing with fonts-sizes, elements colors, margins and paddings to make page looks good.

Deployment

### Technologies Used ###

To complete this project the site developer uses HTML, CSS languages and framework BOOTSTRAP.
